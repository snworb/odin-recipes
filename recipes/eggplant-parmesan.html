    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Eggplant parmesan is a classic Italian dish made with sliced eggplant that's breaded and fried until crispy,
         then layered with tomato sauce and melted mozzarella cheese. It's typically served as a main course and is
          often baked in the oven to create a gooey, cheesy, and delicious meal. The eggplant is typically sliced into rounds,
           dusted with flour, dipped in beaten eggs, and then coated with breadcrumbs before being fried.
            This creates a crispy exterior that contrasts perfectly with the tender eggplant interior.

        Variations on the dish may include the use of different types of cheese, the addition of herbs like basil
         or oregano, or the use of different types of sauce like marinara or arrabiata. Regardless of the variations,
          eggplant parmesan is a popular dish that's loved for its flavor and texture, and it's a staple in many
           Italian-American homes.
